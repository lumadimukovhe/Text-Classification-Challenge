#Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Text Classification Challenge:
The aim of this competition is to classify text content by its relevance to the measurable indicators of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal #3 – Health and Well-Being (SDG 3). Each SDG has several “targets”, or social outcomes that the UN hopes to achieve by 2030. Each of these targets is measured using a set of indicators. These indicators represent the quantitative measurements that will be used to judge whether each SDG target has been achieved or not by 2030.
